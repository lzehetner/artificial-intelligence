        <h2>Operations of AI</h2>
        <p>
            AI systems find a wide variety of applications and functions in computer science. <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Monitoring: </b>An artificial intelligence can process and analyze large amounts of data and detect deviation in a short time. This capability is great for monitoring applications, detecting environmental changes, cyber security, etc.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <b>Detection: </b>AI can intelligently develop solutions from large data sets using dynamic models (data mining) and recognize abstract patterns as well as gain insights from them.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <b>Predict and Interpret: </b>The system can make predictions and build models to predict future trends. It can also recognize patterns from images or video files and interpret them. This type of analysis offers much more freedom than traditional data analysis methods.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <b>Interactions with machines: </b>AI can automate complicated machine-to-machine interactions and coordinate them.
                machine interactions and adapt them. This allows multiple AI systems to communicate with each other. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <b>Interaction with humans: </b>Artificial intelligence makes it easier for humans to communicate with computers, because we can now interact with you using gestures, languages, and facial expressions.
                </li>
